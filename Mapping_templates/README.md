### Mapping Templates in API 

Mapping templates are a powerful feature in API Gateway that allows you to customize and control how data is passed between the client and your backend services. 


In this project, mapping templates in the integration request ofmy API POST request play a crucial role in transforming the incoming request from a client into a format that is suitable for your backend integration. They allow me to control how the data from the client request is passed to my backend service, as well as how the response from my backend service is formatted and sent back to the client.
